## Principles of Visualization
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
This section is based on my lesson [The Visual
Hierarchy](https://github.com/zdelrosario/teaching-eda/tree/master/viz_tasks).
Before the workshop, print several copies of
[grid.pdf](https://github.com/zdelrosario/teaching-eda/blob/master/viz_tasks/grid.pdf)
-- one sheet per pair of workshop participants -- and cut each sheet into six
cards. Each of these cards depicts the __exact__ same data, but in different
ways. These visualizations follow different rungs of Cleveland and McGill's
_Visual Hierarchary_, where the means of displaying data are ordered from
most-to-least accurate at conveying information:

1. Position along a common scale
2. Position along an identical but non-aligned scale
3. Length
4. Angle
5. Area
6. Color saturation

The data themselves are from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and give the
count of various vehicle types in the dataset.

Have the participants split into pairs, and have them answer the following
questions, giving them one prompt to work on at a time.

1. For each visualization, describe how information is visually encoded. Is information shown via shape, position, color, size, or something else? (2 Minutes)
2. Answer the question “Which is larger: The count of wagons with fwd Drive OR the count of wagons with rwd Drive? By how much is one larger than the other?” (2 Minutes)
3. Rank the following visualizations in terms of how well they help you answer question (2) above. Rate the most helpful visualization as 1, and the least helpful as 6; do not allow ties between visualizations. (5 Minutes)

Continue by walking through the Principles of Visualization lesson. Discuss the
tradeoffs between the different visualizations. (15 Minutes)
