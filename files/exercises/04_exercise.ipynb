    "The _primary_ purpose of this notebook is to help you *not get fooled by machine learning*! As Drew Conway notes, possessing hacking skills and substantive experience -- but having no math or statistics background -- puts one in the [danger zone](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram). While we can't possibly cover *everything* you need in a single workshop, this exercise will highlight some of the challenges of doing machine learning well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning outcomes\n",
    "By working through this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use scikit-learn to fit regression models to data\n",
    "* Use cross-validation to help avoid *underfitting* and *overfitting* of data\n",
    "* Train a machine learning model to predict the fatigue strength of metal alloys\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This exercise will make heavy use of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/); you can find lots of useful info on the [documentation site](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)."
