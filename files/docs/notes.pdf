* Overview
The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand the fundamental
principles of visualizing data. This lesson draws on the work of Cleveland and
McGill (1985, /Science/) on the /visual hierarchy/, a quantitative ranking of
different methods of encoding numeric values in a visual fashion. As a result
of working through this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Understand that visualization is accomplished through different /visual
   encoding methods/ -- the rungs on the visual hierarchy
2. Understand that different rungs on the hierarchy convey information more or
   less accurately
3. Use (2) to judge the efficacy of visualizations

Table for *P1: Card sorting*
- You will iteratively build the following table during Part 1:

|---+---+---+------+------------------------------------|
|   |   |   | COM  | Position along a common scale      |
|   |   |   | NON  | Position along a non-aligned scale |

* Part 1: Card sorting
_Before:_ Do the following:
- Prepare to show the following websites (open in tabs):
  + [[https://citrineinformatics.github.io/ga-tech-workshop/05-vis-principles/index.html][Pages site]] -- Main tool for presenting
  + [[http://ils.unc.edu/courses/2015_spring/inls541_001/Readings/Cleveland%20and%20McGill%201985%20-%20Graphical%20Perception%20and%20Cleveland1985-Graphical%20Methods%20for%20Analyzing%20Scientific%20Data.pdf][Cleveland and McGill (1985)]] -- reference for the visual hierarchy
  + [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles][Gapminder visualization]] -- to show how the Gapminder project shows their own data
- Hand out cards for pairs

_Beginning:_ Say the following
- "For the next 50 minutes, we are going to work through a guided exercise
  together. You are going to work together in pairs on a set of questions, and
  we will share ideas in a full group discussin."
- "The cards you have depict a dataset. These data are from a dataset on
  imported cars; the `Count` is the number of vehicles of particular types in
  the dataset. We are going to focus mainly on how the data are displayed."
- "For the moment, we are going to focus on _the same, single variable_,
  displayed in different ways."
- (Show Q1 through Q3 on the [[https://citrineinformatics.github.io/ga-tech-workshop/05-vis-principles/index.html][Pages site]]. *Zoom the page for visibility*.)

_Q1:_ (5 Minutes) How is `Count` displayed?
- Give one answer: "Position along a common scale"
- (While students are working, write the six codes stacked vertically on the
  board in order, i.e. the CODE column in the Table above.)
  + COM, NON, LEN, ANG, PIR2, SAT
- (Walk among students, listen in on their thinking, ask for volunteers to share
  in the larger group. Aim for 2-3 volunteers.)
- (Bring students back together. Get volunteers to share their ideas.)
- (Fill in the full table to disambiguate codenames:)
  + COM -- Common scale
  + NON -- Non-aligned scale
  + LEN -- Length
  + ANG -- Angle
  + PIR2 -- Area
  + SAT -- Color saturation

_Q2:_ (2 Minutes) Answer the questions:
- "Which is larger? The `Count` of `wagons` with `fwd drive` OR the `Count` of
  `wagons` with `rwd drive`?
  (Count of `fwd wagon` is *larger* than `rwd wagon`)
- "By how much is one larger than the other?" (By about 2-3 counts.)
- (Make sure the [[https://citrineinformatics.github.io/ga-tech-workshop/05-vis-principles/index.html][Pages site]] is visible to students; it is difficult to keep
  these questions in one's head!)
- (Can skip walking among the students; this question is very quick.)

_Q3:_ (5 Minutes) Rank the six visualizations /in terms of how well they help you answer
Q2/. Rate the most helpful visualization 1, and the least helpful as 6; do not
allow ties between visualizations. *Make sure to rank at least your top 3.*
- (While students are working, fill in the grid lines from rank 1 to 3. Complete
  the table.)
- (Walk among students, listen in on their thinking, ask why they chose the
  particular rankings they did.)

_Survey:_ (2 Minutes) How many people Ranked COM 1? Ranked COM 2? Ranked COM 3?, etc. until
pattern emerges.
- (Bring students back together. Count hands *for each cell* in the top three
  rows. There should be a nearly-diagonal pattern.)
- Ask "Why are we seeing this pattern of preference? It has to do with the
  /visual hierarchy/."

_Cleveland and McGill (1985)_ (5 Minutes)
- "These visualizations are based on the rungs of Cleveland and McGill's /visual
  hierarchy/. They studied _how accurately_ people could interpret graphs, based
  on how the data were visually encoded. They arrived at the following
  hierarchy, in descending order of accuracy:"
    1. Position along a common scale
    2. Position on identical but nonaligned scales
    3. Length
    4. Angle; Slope (With slope not too close to 0, 90, or 180 degrees)
    5. Area
    6. Volume; Density; Color saturation
    7. Color hue
  + Use [[https://citrineinformatics.github.io/ga-tech-workshop/05-vis-principles/index.html][Pages site]] to quickly show hierarchy
- (An aside: We asked something slightly different -- preference rather than accuracy.)
- [[https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2015_spring/inls541_001/Readings/Cleveland%20and%20McGill%201985%20-%20Graphical%20Perception%20and%20Cleveland1985-Graphical%20Methods%20for%20Analyzing%20Scientific%20Data.pdf][publication link]]

- "We can /use/ this insight to help judge and design graphs."

* Part 2: Gapminder
- Send remote folks to [[https://citrineinformatics.github.io/ga-tech-workshop/04-vis-principles/index.html][online notes]]
- "Now, we are going to consider _four different variables_, displayed on the
  same graph in different ways.
- "The data are from the Gapminder project, which seeks to educate people about
  global poverty."

*Gapminder A vs B*
- _Q1:_ (7 Minutes) Gapminder A
  + (2 Minutes) How are the four variables `Population, GDP per Capita, Life Expectancy at
    Birth, Continent` encoded visually?
    - (Have students Think-Pair-Share)
  + (5 Minutes) What observations can you make about the data based on the vis?
    - (Have students Think-Pair-Share)

- _Q2:_ (4 Minutes) Gapminder B
  + (2 Minutes) How are the four variables `Population, GDP per Capita, Life Expectancy at
    Birth, Continent` encoded visually?
    - (Talk through this; ask for volunteers on the spot.)
  + (2 Minutes) What observations can you make about the data based on the vis?

- *A vs B* (5 Minutes)
  + "I find it easier to see the lower life expectancy in `Africa` based on Gapminder B."
  + "With the /visual hierarchy/, we can be more specific than 'this graph is
    bad' -- we can note that 'Continent has fewer levels, therefore it is easier
    to show with a color scale.'"
  + Same data, same variables, different choice of encoding

*Timeseries 1 vs 2* (1 Minute)
- Walkthrough two different visualizations
- "Here the choice is less obvious; depends on which variable I care about more
  -- GDP / capita or Life expectancy."
- "*Visualization is an iterative process.*"

* Finale
- Wrapup (5 Minutes) "What did we talk about?"

- "Variables/numbers are /encoded/ visually to make a graph; we choose how to encode"
  + (Gesture to the table to remind)
- "We need to make these decisions when constructing a visualization."
  + (Scroll through the Gapminder examples, use them to illustrate different choices.)
- Lessons:
  + *Use our linear scales preferentially* -- reserve for the "most important"
    continuous variables
  + *Use secondary scales strategically* -- use for "secondary" variables, or
    categorical variables
- *Visualization is an iterative process*
   + We won't get the design perfect the first time.
  + What is "good" depends on our goals; exploratory graphs have very different
    goals than communication graphs.
